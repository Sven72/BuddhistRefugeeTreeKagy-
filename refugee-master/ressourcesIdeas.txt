9. Karmapa:
JEWELS FROM THE TREASURY
This book contains a translation of one of the greatest presentations of abhidharma in any tradition: Vasubandhu’s Verses on the Treasury of Abhidharma, along with the 9th Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje’s clear and concise explanation of it, Youthful Play (ཆོས་མངོན་པ་མཛོད་དང་། དེའི་འགྲེལ་པ་གཞོན་ནུ་རྣམ་རོལ།), translated by David Karma Choephel.


Based on this question
https://www.sitepoint.com/community/t/how-to-position-modal-dialog-at-x-y-coordinates-of-click-event/224882

I came up with first idea to place modal near clicked object:
window.addEventListener('click', (evt) => {
console.log(evt.clientX);
})

    Chökyi Wangchuk, the Sixth Shamar Rinpoche (1584c.1635), was recognized at an early age by his principal guru, the Ninth Gyalwang Karmapa, Wangchuk Dorje. Demonstrating swift accomplishment in his training and tremendous proficiency in debate and scholarship, he became one of the most renowned panditas of his era. He traveled and taught extensively throughout Tibet, China, and Nepal, and performed vast activity for the benefit of beings. Just as the Golden Garland of the Kagyu succession continued with Chökyi Wangchuk himself, he in turn recognized the tenth incarnation of the Gyalwang Karmapa, Chöying Dorje, who then became his principal disciple.
