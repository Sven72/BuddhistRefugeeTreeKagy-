\f1\b0 , was a {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_Buddhism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tibetan Buddhist}} master. Known as "The Buddha from {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolpo"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 D\'f6lpo}}," a region in modern {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepal"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Nepal}}, he was the principal exponent of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shentong"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 shentong}} teachings, and an influential member of the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonang"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jonang}} tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. \

D\'f6lpopa was born in D\'f6lpo. In 1309, when he was seventeen, he ran away from home to seek the Buddhist teachings, first in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Mustang"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Mustang}} and then in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibet"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tibet}}.{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolpopa_Sherab_Gyaltsen#cite_note-3"}}{\fldrslt 
\fs20 \cf3 \super \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 [3]}} In 1314, when he was twenty-two years old, D\'f6lpopa received {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhikkhu"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 full monastic ordination}} from the famous abbot of Choelung Monastery, S\'f6nam Trakpa (1273\'961352), and made a vow at the time to never eat slaughtered meat again\
\
\
In 1321, D\'f6lpopa visited Jonang Monastery at Jomonang (which was later destroyed during the {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Cultural Revolution}}) for the first time. He then visited {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsurphu_Monastery"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tsurphu Monastery}} for the first time and had extensive discussions with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rangjung_Dorje,_3rd_Karmapa_Lama"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Rangjung Dorje, 3rd Karmapa Lama}}, about doctrinal issues. It appears that the Karmapa Lama almost certainly influenced the development of some of D\'f6lpopa's theories, possibly including

In time, D\'f6lpopa became one of the most influential and original yet controversial of Tibetan Buddhist teachers, systemizing {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha-nature"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Buddha-nature}} and Yogacara-Madhyamaka teachings in teaching known as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shentong"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 shentong}} ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wylie_transliteration"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Wylie}}:

SUPRESSION\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0
\cf2 The entire corpus of D\'f6lpopa's writings was completely suppressed by the dominant Gelug school for several hundred years, for both doctrinal and political reasons. The doctrinal reason was his approach to the Buddhist concept of {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9A%C5%ABnyat%C4%81"}}{\fldrslt
