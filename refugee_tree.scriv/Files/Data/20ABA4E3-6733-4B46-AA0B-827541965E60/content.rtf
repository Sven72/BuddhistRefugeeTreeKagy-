At this point in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Buddhism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Buddhist history}}, the Buddhist community was already divided into various {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_Buddhism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Buddhist schools}} and had spread throughout India. \
At this time, there was already a small and nascent Mah\uc0\u257 y\u257 na movement. Mah\u257 y\u257 na ideas were held by a minority of Buddhists in India at the time. As Joseph Walser writes, "Mah\u257 y\u257 na before the fifth century was largely invisible and probably existed only as a minority and largely unrecognized movement within the fold of nik\u257 ya Buddhism."{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagarjuna#cite_note-6"}}{\fldrslt
